                        My first job was as a Ride Operator at Morey's Piers. Specifically, I operated the carousel for the summer of 2021.
                        I thoroughly enjoyed this job because of the excellant work environment and the self-growth I attained during this time. 
                        Much of that self-growth consisted the learning the ability to say no and to be somewhat authoritative. It's hard to work with kids
                        but I learned that service with a smile is always the best approach.

                            My time as a research intern at the USGS, we worked on a solution to develop a
                            cloud-based 3D basemap of populated areas and surrounding wildland terrain to 
                            enhance the decision-making process in wildfire management. The model was designed to use 
                            GIS, XR, AI, and other advanced digital technologies to create a more intuitive and visual interface for fire professionals and the public. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My particular role within the research program was to help develop an experimental convolutional neural network to 
                            help identify the likelihood of fire by a series a crowd-sourced images of flora in the local area. This internship allowed
                            me to learn quite a bit about machine learning and CNNs in general. As well I learned the dynamics of the Agile framework
                            and how it is important to stay flexible within a project that switches direction continously.

                        My second job was actually at the same place: Morey's Piers. This time around I was a lifeguard and I would argue I had an even better
                        time this summer. I thoroughly enjoyed this job because of the friends I made along the way and the excellant tan I got! This job taught 
                        me the importance of being authoriative once again. Safety was very important for this job which means anything between saves in the water,
                        rule enforcement, or conducting audits.
