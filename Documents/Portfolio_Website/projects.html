                                My time as a research intern at the USGS, we worked on a solution to develop a
                                cloud-based 3D basemap of populated areas and surrounding wildland terrain to 
                                enhance the decision-making process in wildfire management. The model was designed to use 
                                GIS, XR, AI, and other advanced digital technologies to create a more intuitive and visual interface for fire professionals and the public.

                                My particular role within the research program was to help develop an experimental convolutional neural network to 
                                help identify the likelihood of fire by a series a crowd-sourced images of flora in the local area. This internship allowed
                                me to learn quite a bit about machine learning and CNNs in general. As well I learned the dynamics of the Agile framework
                                and how it is important to stay flexible within a project that switches direction continously.

                                My project with JavaFX chess is a fully functioning chess game programmed in Java using JavaFX as the graphical utility.
                                The main programming concepts used are inheritance and abstract classes. Every piece is a subclass of the abstract class Piece. This enables code reuse to a great capacity.
                                The board is created using a GridPane with Square objects inhabiting the cells of the grid. Within the Square object is the designated piece and the location of the square.

                                I am most proud of this project as it was a bit of a struggle at times especially when trying to debug a fairly large project such as this one. It also affirms
                                my affection for the game of chess. I play chess fairly regularly but don't ask to play me. I'm not that good :(

                                During my high school years, I was the programmer for my robotics high school team. I programmed an autonomous and tele-operable
                                robot in Java to compete for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition. This robot used graduate level robotics control theory such as PID and route pathing
                                to enhance control and effciency of the robot during competition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the patient zero of my programming journey. Robotics was such as impactful experience on my life and career that I majored in Computer Science
                                and found a passion for programming. Still, even in college, this project remains one of the greatest projects I have ever worked on.
                                That's me on the far left with the flag by the way :)
