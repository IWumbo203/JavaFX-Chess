# JavaFX-Chess

Welcome to my JavaFX Chess Repository! Check out the code! It is a fully functioning chess game programmed in Java using JavaFX as the graphical utility. 
The main programming concepts used are inheritance and abstract classes. Every piece is a subclass of the abstract class 
Piece. This enables code reuse to a great capacity. The board is created using a GridPane with Square objects inhabiting 
the cells of the grid. Within the Square object is the designated piece and the location of the square.
